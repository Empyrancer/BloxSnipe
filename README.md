BloxSnipe
==============

BloxSnipe is an experimental open-source script for sniping Roblox limiteds written in Python. 

### Usage
* Step 1: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer so that you can run this program. If you don't, go to python.org and download it.

* Step 2: Edit the .py file, and modify the configuration variables aas needed

* Step 3: Save the file and run the program, and wait. It will open the page of the item as soon as someone sells it for your target price. 
    
### Additional Information
* This does not do anything with your Roblox cookie or your personal data. This script is completely safe to use.

* This script will not automatically buy the limited for you. It will only take you to the page, so buy it as soon as the page loads.

* The more items you try to scan at the same time, the longer it will take (for obvious reasons)
